Poject 7 at Udacity Android Basics nanodegree program

This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists a kind of attraction, national park, or historical monument for Saint-Petersburg city in Russia where I am living.

I used all my knowledge I gained till project 7. The main requirement was to use View Pager and TabLayout as well as ListView/GridView or RecyclerView.

Additionally share functionality was implemented using custom ShareActionProvider and Image slider. Also CoordinatorLayout with AppBarLayout was used to create animation while scrolling. 

## Pre-requisites
* Android SDK v29 (min SDK v23)
* Android Build Tools v29.0.2

## Getting Started
The app uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the "gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
